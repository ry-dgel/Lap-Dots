Scripts contains a few scripts that are called by various other programs, these
are assumed to be in $HOME/Scripts. 

I've provided my .xinit, but it contains a few things you probably don't want

Have fun tweaking the pixel commands in sxhkdrc and polybar config.

neovim config requires vimplug.

Files go in:
~/.zshrc
~/.xinitrc
~/.config/sxhkd/sxhkdrc
~/.config/bspwm/bspwmrc
~/.config/polybar/config
~/.config/termite/config
~/.config/nvim/init.vim
